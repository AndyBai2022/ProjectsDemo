Video demo of my projects

1. Search Audio by Text
   
    Coded with C# (WPF application in Visual Studio 2022). User can input a keyword and then search in the audio database to retrieve words or sentences contain that specified keyword. The search results will be shown in waveform and text as well. User can adjust the start time and end time of the audio and then save the adjusted audio as a local file.

2. Subtitle Generator

   User can upload a video file and then convert the video to mp3, upload this mp3 file and user will get an excel file with text and timeline for the audio file. Then user can get a subtitle file (srt) by clicking the CC icon.

3. Read Along Generator
   Generate read-along webpages based on the excel file which was generated from an audio file user uploaded. First, user should edit the excel file based on the desired paragraph formatting. Use tag "t" to indicate that the item is part of the title, tag "p" to start a new paragraph and tag "P" to start a new page.
